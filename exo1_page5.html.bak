	<h2>Crane</h2>
	<h3>CC-5933 - He/Him</h3>
	<p>He was a very caring person, always trying to get Fox to take care of himself. He was the only one Fox allowed to see him break at the beginning.</p>
	<p>He was the same age as Fox.</p>
	<p>He died in the 5th month of the war during a blackout.</p>
	<p>A patrol found his body in the lower levels.</p>
	<p>He was one of the two commanders the guard started with.</p>
	<p>Thorn and Stone were sent to replace him, as well as to help even out the growing workload of the guard.</p>
